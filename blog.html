                <h2>Question 1: What is dom and what is the purpose of dom?</h2>
                <h3><span>Answer : </span>In website development, DOM stands for Document Object Model. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page. It allows us to create, change, or remove elements from a website document. DOM manipulation is when you use JavaScript to add, remove, and modify elements of a website. It is very common in web development.

                <h2>Question 3: What is event bubbling ?</h2>
                <h3><span>Answer : </span>Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy. In event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.</h3>

A more formal definition would be - Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.</h3>
